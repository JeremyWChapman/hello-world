Sample repository - learning GitHub principles

Hello World,

I have been working on some home automation projects, but my code is a mess and I keep pulling in code from other peoples projects and then forgetting where I got it. I'd much rather have an organized approach that will allow me to learn, experiment, explore, and even contribute to other projects. As such, I thought I should learn a bit more about GitHub since that seems to be the best central repository for code, and it is where most of the projects that I work on are stored.
